# <u>Maze 2: Project II: Design a cloud infrastructure security for an SME.

# Procedure #

1. Understand the business and its Security Needs:
   
    •	Start by understanding the business security requirements, compliance obligations, and of course the risk tolerance level.
   
    •	Identify the types of data required for storage in the cloud and its sensitivity level.
   
    •	Study the specific threats and vulnerabilities that pertain to that industry and use its cases.


3. Choose the right secure cloud provider:
 
    •	Select a reputable cloud service provider known for its strong security practices and compliance certifications. The three leading cloud companies (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) could be considered
   
    •	Get to understand which security aspects the cloud provider manages and what you're responsible for securing.


5. Define Your Security Policies:
   
    •	Establish clear security policies and procedures that align with your organization's needs and industry regulations.
   
    •	Define access control policies, encryption standards, incident response procedures, and data retention policies.

6. Secure Access and Identity:
   
    •	Implement strong identity and access management (IAM) controls to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access your cloud resources.
   
    •	Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.
   
    •	Regularly review and audit IAM permissions to prevent over-privileged accounts.
   

8. Data Encryption:
   
    •	Encrypt data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption methods.
   
    •	Use key management services provided by your cloud provider to manage encryption keys securely.
   

10. Network Security:
   
    •	Set up network security groups or security groups to control traffic to and from your cloud resources.
    
    •	Use virtual private clouds (VPCs) or virtual networks to isolate resources and create segmented networks.
    

12. Security Monitoring and Logging:

    •	Enable cloud provider monitoring and logging services to track activities within your environment.
    
    •	Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) for real-time threat detection.
    
    •	Centralize and analyze logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.
    

14. Incident Response and Disaster Recovery:
   
  •	Develop an incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in case of a security incident.
  
  •	Create and test disaster recovery and backup strategies to ensure data availability and continuity.
